It stands for \"initialize\" and is used to initialize the attributes of an object. Basically it is used to define a constructor. Below code is used for this purpose"

    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), the self word is used as a convention to refer to the instance of a class. It represents the current object that a method is being called on. The self parameter is the first parameter in almost all instance methods in Python classes. When a method is called on an instance, the instance itself is automatically passed as the first argument to the method, and by convention, this argument is named self. However, you can choose any name for this parameter, but using self is a widely accepted convention in Python. The following code can be referred.."

    "OR Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It provides a way to create new classes (derived or child classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes), forming a hierarchical relationship."
